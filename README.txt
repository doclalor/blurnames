/* 
   The Blur Names block is created by Brendan Lalor, and released for all.
   
   WHY: It helps protect student privacy, that FERPA-compliance might not dampen 
   our Moodle spirit. 
   
   WHAT: The Blur Names block helps conceal information that might otherwise 
   reveal the identities of students when faculty are displaying Moodle courses 
   to each other. 
   
   HOW: The presence of this block on gradebook and some other pages will blur 
   the names, email addresses, and images of students - e.g., in both the Grader
   and User Reports; and it will do the same for names in Moodle core's Forum, 
   and in the Choice module, as well. This protection of student privacy allows 
   for more FERPA-friendly sharing among faculty. 

   Take whatever block-placement measures are appropriate in your situation to
   ensure that the block is loaded on the relevant pages. For the simplest 
   cases, when you want to use it, add it to all pages in the left column (so 
   that it's loaded even when there is no column on the right). This is not a
   one-size-fits-all strategy; so adapt it! 
   
   CAVEATS: 
   1. The block will not presently blur names in tooltips, which appear 
   when hovering over gradebook cells.
   2. The block has not been designed to blur names in modules beyond those 
   listed: Choice, Forum, and in the Gradebook. 
   3. The block has not been tested for Moodle releases prior to 2.6. However 
   there's nothing too snazzy in it; so it should work with earlier releases 
   as long as they feature the relevant CSS class and ID names. 
   
   SOLICITATIONS: If you know a CSS-method for blurring the names in tooltips 
   that appear while hover over gradebook cells, please share it with me. 
   JavaScript solutions are welcome as well. In future releases, I'll also try 
   to honor requests for CSS-based extensions. Drop me a note at 
   Brendan.Lalor@castleton.edu.
